# Explain ech output of the program below:
# Give 3 usecases or  cenarios where you can apply the program below.
# Write the code for 1 of the 3 use cases.

# 4==5 : False
# This is a comparison operator that indicatet true or false . Therfore 4 does not equal to 5 and it is false.


# 4 !=5 : True
# This is a comparison operator that indicate that 4 does not equal to 5. Therefore it is True.
 
# 4 > 5 : False
# This is a comparison operator that indicate true or false. Therefore 4 is not greater than 5. This is a false statement.

# 4 < 5 : True
# True  indicates that 4 is less than 5, therefore it is true.
